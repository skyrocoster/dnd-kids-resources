# Write the approved focused Plan

Write the Plan from retained case context and the frontier's corrections. Do not restart broad repository
exploration, implement code, or author work orders.

Require `PROPOSAL APPROVED`, exact `TARGET PATH`, and `FRONTIER CORRECTIONS`. For a real active Plan,
the target must match `docs/plans/active/<feature>/<feature>.md`: the feature directory is required and
the Plan filename must repeat the feature name so future `NN-<slug>.md` work orders can be colocated.
Reject a flat active-Plan target before writing; normalize it to the nested form only when the coordinator
has explicitly authorized that correction. A path under `scratch/` is allowed only when the user explicitly
authorized that simulation path.

1. Apply every frontier correction without reopening settled decisions.
2. Validate the target shape before any write. Create the approved feature directory as needed, and move an
   already-written flat Plan only when that move is explicitly authorized; never silently leave a real Plan
   at `docs/plans/active/<feature>.md`.
3. For a real active Plan, validate every `Touches` entry as a repo-relative glob that currently matches at
   least one existing file or directory. Keep exact paths for future files in the stage compiler handoff;
   never create placeholder production files merely to satisfy the documentation checker.
4. For a real active Plan, use the Layer 1 schema in `docs/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`: Status, Areas, Read trigger, human
   outcome, stages, empty Shipped table, Touches, and stage-grouped compiler handoff. Include UX decisions in the
   Plan when frontend work requires them; do not invoke a separate interview when conservative defaults were
   approved.
5. Keep human-facing sections concise. Require explicit observable acceptance and exclusions before writing.
   Preserve paid-for repository answers in the compiler handoff: exact
   owning symbols/state flow, precedents, existing test behaviors, consumers/defaults, relevant CSS/shell
   constraints, useful absent-precedent searches, settled contracts, and true open lookup questions.
6. Touches are ownership globs, not an accidental list that forbids a likely feature-local component. Do not
   authorize unrelated consumer paths merely because they need regression protection. Conditional paths and
   verification-only files are not unconditional Touches; preserve their escalation/verification status.
7. Record frontier-settled stage routing as `ORDERED` or `QUICK-CANDIDATE`, never `ORDERED-CANDIDATE`. Keep
   one coherent stage when partial work would not be a valid human-visible shipment; internal sequencing
   belongs in work orders.
8. For a real active Plan, run `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/check_docs.py --write-generated`, inspect that
   generated changes are regeneration-shaped, then run `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/check_docs.py --check`.
   A user-authorized scratch simulation is outside the docs contract and runs neither command.
9. Never commit.
