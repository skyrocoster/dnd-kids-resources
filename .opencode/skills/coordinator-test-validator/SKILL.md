# Experimental validator phase machine

This skill defines capabilities; it does not authorize invoking them. A future handoff must name exactly one phase,
provide immutable inputs and approved paths, and include every required coordinator or human approval.

## Fixed phases and transitions

The only order is `INTAKE` → `VALIDATE` → `REVALIDATE` → `PROPOSE CLOSEOUT` → `APPLY CLOSEOUT` →
`ARCHIVE AND CLEAN` → `VERIFY CLOSEOUT` → `COMMIT`. A failure or block stops the machine. No phase may infer
approval, skip a phase, or execute a later phase.

- **INTAKE:** accept only an observable proof packet, diff/baseline facts, exact checks, artifacts, immutable paths,
  and phase-specific approvals. Reject implementation narrative, unstated paths, or missing gates.
- **VALIDATE:** run supplied independent checks from fresh context. Product implementation, tests, configuration,
  and documentation are immutable. Do not diagnose or repair product behavior.
- **REVALIDATE:** retained-session follow-up only after an explicit coordinator handoff; rerun supplied proof.
- **PROPOSE CLOSEOUT:** retained-session evidence review only; produce a bounded manifest. Do not apply anything.
- **APPLY CLOSEOUT:** only after coordinator approval; update explicitly approved order evidence, Plan Status/Shipped,
  canonical docs, generated inventories, and manifest/index paths. No product files.
- **ARCHIVE AND CLEAN:** only after approval and proof every Plan stage is complete. Archive completed Plans to
  `docs/plans/done/`, update manifest/indexes, unblock dependencies through valid archival, remove completed
  work-order artifacts and empty leftover folders, and preserve redirect stubs only for known inbound links.
- **VERIFY CLOSEOUT:** run applicable order, stage, and documentation checks. Permit at most one deterministic
  metadata/generated-doc repair inside the approved manifest; never repair product implementation.
- **COMMIT:** final only after successful validation and closeout verification, required human acceptance, and
  coordinator commit approval. Inspect status/diff/log, stage only the approved manifest, rerun final checks, create
   one commit, verify commit/worktree state, and never push.

Closeout metadata reads require `validator: coordinator-test-validator`, the exact phase,
`coordinator_approved: true`, and the exact non-empty `approved_paths` list. The harness allows only matching
manifest paths and never exempts `scripts/browser_validation.py` or earlier validation phases.

Independent validation receives no implementation narrative: only observable expectations and baseline/diff facts.
Missing approval, path drift, unexpected diff scope, incomplete stages, ambiguous inbound links, failed checks,
dirty unrelated work, or a request to push are `BLOCKED`. COMMIT is single-use and terminal.

Return `PHASE`, `RESULT`, `COMMANDS`, `EVIDENCE`, `ARTIFACTS`, `APPROVALS`, `SCOPE`, `NEXT`, and `ISSUE`.
