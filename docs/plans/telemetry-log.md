# Work-order telemetry log

Auto-appended by `scripts/order_telemetry.py` after each dispatched work order reports
back. One entry per order run; order files are deleted at reconcile, so this log is the
durable record. Reviewed periodically (every ~10-15 dispatches) to tighten the
plan/to-orders/implement-order rules - look for repeated large reads, duplicate reads,
reads outside START IN, and executor deviations.

Token notes: "fresh input" = uncached input actually paid at full rate (includes cache
writes); "cache read" is cheap. "largest tool results" sizes are estimated at ~4
chars/token. Cost drivers to optimise: fresh input, output, and turn count.

The "compiler note" line is the dispatcher's own read of the run, written at dispatch
time via `--note`: why the numbers look as they do, and which cost drivers trace back to
how the order was compiled rather than to the executor. The measured lines say what
happened; the note says what to do differently when compiling the next stage, while the
order file still exists to check against. "not recorded" means that judgement was lost.

"first pass" is the number actually worth optimising. Executor runs cost cents; a
re-dispatch costs a cold start, the planner's attention, and often a stalled dependency
chain - far more than the token spread between a clean run and a verbose one. Read the
token lines as a diagnosis of *why* an order thrashed, not as the target.

"order shape (compiled)" measures the order rather than the executor: required strength,
how many files START IN named, how many lines they hold, how many were left unscoped,
how many behaviours DO asked for, and how many artifacts it creates or removes. Nearly
every compiler note below concludes the order was at fault, so this is the column to
correlate an expensive run against - and it is only capturable now, since order files are
deleted at reconcile.

Entries marked "(reconcile)" are stage-level, written once per stage by the `reconcile`
skill rather than per order. Their "escaped targeted checks" lines are the ones to read
first in a review pass: each is a defect that passed an order's own STOP WHEN and was
only caught by the full suites, the typecheck or the contract checks. A repeat across
stages means the fix belongs in the `to-orders` template, not in another one-off note.

## Closed cycle - 2026-07-25 (12 order runs, Map Lab UX stages 7-8)

The log's first full cycle was reviewed and its lessons converted into enforcement:

- Order-shape faults became `scripts/check_orders.py` rules: unresolvable paths, edit
  sites absent from START IN, bare filenames or symbols, conditional instructions,
  unscoped large files, fixtures without the cast idiom plus a typecheck, and several
  behaviours aimed at one large integrated suite.
- The `src/model/` layering rule became an `oxlint` `no-restricted-imports` override.
- Carried frontend failures moved to `frontend/known-test-failures.json` and are judged by
  `npm run test:check`.
- `scripts/order_telemetry.py` stopped guessing when an executor child record is absent.

Two non-mechanical lessons remain compiler judgement:

- Describe a precedent's relevant shape in KNOWN STATE instead of sending the executor to
  read it. One logical change with likely-wrong facts pre-answered was the cheapest run.
- Async orders around `useMapLabSessionState` must name the initial-load save-suppression
  seam. Split hook error reporting from page-level placement.

## Closed cycle - 2026-07-26 (24 runs, 22 orders, docs-restructure stages 1-5)

Twenty-one of 22 unique orders completed without a cold re-dispatch. Order 16 accounted
for the two cancelled runs and completed once its fixture-root error and link contract
were diagnosed explicitly. Model escalation did not solve the under-specified order;
correct order shape did. Stages 3 and 5 reconciled with no escaped targeted checks.

The repeated findings are now enforced:

- Work orders declare `REQUIRED STRENGTH`, `CREATES`, and `REMOVES`. Lifecycle artifacts
  are authorized separately from START IN, named in DO, asserted directly by STOP WHEN,
  and checked for their final state when an order is DONE.
- Structural documentation orders run `scripts/check_docs.py --check`. This closes the
  Stage 2 class where missing artifacts, stale links, stale manifest rows, and move/delete
  self-invalidation passed targeted pytest.
- Validator changes include their direct test module in START IN and STOP WHEN. The
  Stage 1 discovery-contract escape can no longer omit `backend/tests/test_check_orders.py`.
- Independently runnable orders may not share mutable paths. A dependency is required
  when one order edits or removes a file another consumes, preventing the Orders 06/07
  shared-input race.
- The executor may edit documentation explicitly authorized by the order; the previous
  code-and-tests-only rule contradicted the successful documentation restructuring work.
- Dispatch paths now match `docs/plans/active/<feature>/NN-<slug>.md`, and model strength
  is an explicit order field rather than dispatcher inference.
- Telemetry order shape now records required strength and lifecycle artifact counts.

The cost outliers remained compiler faults, not evidence for stronger default models:

- Order 05 read all area guides because a parser order omitted representative documents.
- Order 15 repaired seven guide tables absent from its declared edit sites because earlier
  orders were not prevalidated against the exact coverage universe.
- Order 16 looped because its fixture helper wrote under the wrong temporary root and the
  assertion hid the actionable checker error.

Compiler judgement still required after this cycle:

- For validator work, name representative real documents for every accepted grammar
  shape and one fixture for every rejected target class stated in KNOWN STATE.
- Expand proposed coverage globs against the real implementation universe before writing
  the orders, so the final enforcement order verifies rather than repairs prior work.
- Locate symbols with grep before reading ranges from large checker, test, Plan, or
  telemetry files. Keep future-created paths in CREATES, not START IN.

Reset here for the next cycle. Nothing below this line predates 2026-07-26.
